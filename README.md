## Quick Description
This graphical user interface, or GUI, will allow users to easily run analyses on shape and motion data of cells to find correlations. The two main modes for ease of use are selecting type of substrate and figures desired. This GUI is part of a larger project which aims to describe unique behaviors cells exhibit when moving on different substrates. The GUI is built using a docker contianer.
